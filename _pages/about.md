Hey, I am an incoming Master's student in the [Machine Learning Department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) at CMU. Previously, I studied Computer Science and Statistics at the University of Waterloo. I have been extremely lucky to have worked with [Prof. Gautam Kamath](http://www.gautamkamath.com/), [Florian Kerschbaum](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~fkerschb/), [Yaoliang Yu](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~y328yu/), [Jimmy Lin](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/).

You can reach me at [m[lastname]4@andrew.cmu.edu]().
